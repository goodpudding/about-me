        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <p> Born into a military family in South Carolina, I mostly grew up in Alaska with my Moms side of the family. 
            I moved quite a bit, so I constantly had to learn how to adapt to new situations.
             I have lived in Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Georgia, California and I moved to Washington state in 2019.

        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>I graduated in 2008 at Mountain Home High School in 2008. I took courses here and there about computer networking and IT, but it wasn't until I got out of the military that I started taking college more serious. I attend the Art Institute in San Francisco 2015 for Video Game Programming and Desing, but I took a film elective and thought that was more fun, so switched my major. In the winter of 2018, the school shut down and I transferred to the Seattle campus at the beginning of 2019. 2 months later, the Art Institute of Seattle shut its doors permanetly. I was able to transfer my credits to the Seattle Film Institute and finish my Bachelors of Arts in Digital Media Productions in the fall of 2019.

        <h2>Job experience</h2>
        <p>I've always had a pretty good work ethic. My younger years, I did the typical mow yard, rake leaves, etc. My mom ran a daycare in my early teens and I took a babysitters course and started babysitting for my moms clients. My first official job was TacoBell and I did fast food/customer service until I finally got fed up with it and decided to join the military. I served 4 years in the US Army as a satellite communications specialist. It was a great experience and I learned a lot, but did not enjoy the military life style. I got out and used the GI bill to go to film school. When I graduated film school, I couldn't find any work in the field and I started working with a company that builds catios in the Seattle area. After working with them for 2 years, I decided to become a general contractor and have been running my general contracting business.
